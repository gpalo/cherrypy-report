# High-Level Summary

I was tasked with performing an internal penetration test towards Offensive Security Exam.
An internal penetration test is a dedicated attack against internally connected systems.
The focus of this test is to perform attacks, similar to those of a hacker and attempt to infiltrate Offensive Security’s internal exam systems – the THINC.local domain.
My overall objective was to evaluate the network, identify systems, and exploit flaws while reporting the findings back to Offensive Security.

When performing the internal penetration test, there were several alarming vulnerabilities that were identified on Offensive Security’s network.
When performing the attacks, I was able to gain access to multiple machines, primarily due to outdated patches and poor security configurations.
During the testing, I had administrative level access to multiple systems.
All systems were successfully exploited and access granted.
These systems as well as a brief description on how access was obtained are listed below:
